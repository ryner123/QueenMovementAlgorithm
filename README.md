# QueenMovementAlgorithm
Just another repository on displaying the movements of a queen across a board. 

Basically the algorithm here is that the user/person/you selects the first position of the queen. That could be anywhere across the board. Now, the code kicks in. The movement or the lines the first queen could pass through will be made unavailable for other queens. The position of the second queen will then be determined by the system then do the same step until all positions are occupied by queens.

By the way, PHP, CSS3, and JQUERY are used. (=^_^=)
